# üß† devwm ‚Äî A heavily customized chadwm/dwm fork for Gentoo.


**devwm** is a heavily customized fork of [chadwm](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm), tailored for Gentoo users who want a more aesthetic dwm rice. It integrates transparency, fading effects, EWW widget toggling, and a custom Rofi theme ‚Äî all modified with Gentoo in mind, but can be adapted to other distros.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Alpha Patch for Transparency**  
  Enables true window transparency using the official [alpha patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/), compatible with picom.

- **WindowMap Patch for Fading**  
  Adds smooth fade-in/out transitions to window events, enhancing visual polish.

- **EWW Toggle Keybind**  
  A custom keybinding allows you to show/hide EWW widget instantly.

- **Custom Rofi Theme**  
  Includes a personalized Rofi configuration with transparency, left-centered layout, and modern styling.
